# CHAT-BOT

## OVERVIEW

I often think about how much people place emphasis on seeming like they care and not on how much they actually care. It is commonplace to put up a front of being interested when someone talks to you — even more so when people become vulnerable with you. I also find myself doing this. A lot of people do this from a place of not wanting to hurt others, but I wonder why the care can’t come from a place of genuine concern more. I still don’t know if there’s an easy answer to this, but I hope my project will help people become more aware of this.

This project is an expansion on a [previous project](https://github.com/trishnguyen2001/radical-play) of mine.

### CONCEPT

My project will allow its users to rant their thoughts and feelings in a chat room format, and the program will respond. Depending on what “care level” the user sets, the program will send different responses. For example, if the user wants the program to respond sympathetically to their rant, they will set the care level to high. This project was meant to make people question their default responses when others open up to them about hardships. It can be hard to know what to say, but I think we could all be a bit more genuine in our responses.
